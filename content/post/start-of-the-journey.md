Welcome to **The Engineer’s Notebook**, a place where I document my experiences, insights, and technical explorations as a software engineer.  

I’m **Javad Rajbzadeh**, a **senior software engineer** with over a **decade of experience** in software development, system architecture, and blockchain technology. Throughout my career, I’ve built, scaled, and optimized software systems across various domains, from backend engineering and distributed system and AI-driven applications.  

## What This Notebook Is About  

This blog is my personal space for:  
- **Sharing technical insights** – deep dives into software architecture, blockchain, Golang, and cloud engineering.  
- **Documenting challenges and solutions** – the real-world problems I encounter and how I solve them.  
- **Exploring new technologies** – my thoughts on emerging trends, tools, and best practices in the industry.  
- **Reflecting on the journey** – lessons learned from years of engineering, debugging, and refining my craft.  

I believe that **engineering is more than just writing code**—it’s about solving problems, thinking critically, and continuously improving. This notebook will serve as both a **personal log** and a **resource for other engineers** who are navigating their own journeys.
